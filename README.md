# Project Generator

A fast, interactive CLI tool to scaffold Go projects with boilerplate code and best practices. Spin up new HTTP backends, CLI applications, or empty Go projects in seconds.

## Overview

Project Generator is a Go-based project scaffolding tool that removes the friction of starting new projects. Answer a few interactive questions, and get a fully structured project with:

- Pre-configured project layouts
- Optional database integrations (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Test case templates for HTTP backends
- Multiple CLI frameworks (Cobra, Bubble Tea, Huh)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

Perfect for rapidly prototyping, learning Go, or maintaining consistent project structure across your team.

## Features

**Interactive Setup**
- Beautiful terminal UI with form validation
- Step-by-step project configuration
- Smart conditional prompts (database options only for HTTP backends)

**Project Templates**
- HTTP Backend - RESTful API with optional database and tests
- CLI Application - Command-line tools with multiple framework options
- Empty Project - Minimal Go project structure

**Database Support**
- PostgreSQL (PGX driver)
- MySQL
- None (for non-database projects)

**Testing**
- Optional test case templates for HTTP backends
- Pre-configured testing structure

**CLI Frameworks**
- Cobra - Standard flag-based CLI applications
- Bubble Tea - Interactive TUI (Text User Interface) applications
- Huh - Beautiful form-based CLI tools

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.26 or higher

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bran7230/projectGenerator.git
cd projectGenerator
go build -o project-gen main.go
```

### Setting up PATH

Just run the binary. On its first run it offers to install itself, and answering
yes copies it to a user-local bin directory and adds that directory to your PATH:

| Platform | Installed to | PATH updated in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.local/bin` | `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.config/fish/config.fish` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\project-gen` | the per-user `Path` variable |

No admin rights or `sudo` are needed. Open a new terminal afterwards so the shell
picks up the new PATH, then run `project-gen` from any directory.

If you skipped the prompt, run the install again at any time:

```bash
./project-gen --install
```

Or through the makefile:

```bash
make install
```

## Usage

Run the generator:
```bash
./project-gen
# or if installed globally
project-gen
```

### Interactive Prompts

1. **Project Name** - Enter a name for your new project
2. **Project Type** - Choose between:
   - Http-Backend
   - Cli-Application
   - Empty-Project
3. **Database** (HTTP Backend only) - Select database framework
4. **Test Cases** (HTTP Backend only) - Include test templates
5. **CLI Framework** (CLI Application only) - Select your CLI tool

### Example Workflow

```
$ project-gen

     ____             _           __          ______
    / __ \_________  (_)__  _____/ /_        / ____/___  ____
   / /_/ / ___/ __ \/ / _ \/ ___/ __/_______/ / __/ __ \/ __ \
  / ____/ /  / /_/ / /  __/ /__/ /_/_______/ /_/ /  __/ / / /
 /_/   /_/   \____/ /\___/\___/\__/        \____/\___/_/ /_/
              /___/

Enter project name: my-awesome-api
Confirm project name? Yes
Choose a project: Http-Backend
Confirm project type? Yes
Choose a database framework: PostgreSQL(PGX driver)
Confirm database? Yes
Include test cases? Yes

Project scaffolded successfully!
Project location: /path/to/my-awesome-api
```

Then start developing:
```bash
cd my-awesome-api
go run main.go
```
